Welcome to the [OS Journey](https://muhammadichsan.com/tags) series 🥳, in this series we will learn together about operating systems in depth. To understand the OS, of course, we also have to learn about computer science, because these two things are related. 

Before we start into main topic (OS) later we will also discuss such as CPU, Memory Management, and Kernel, of course this will be fun to learn right😄?

For the introduction we will first learn about the boot process because this is the main control flow and underlies how the operating system will work later.

> For now and future in this series I will make assembly code with x86 architecture, considering this architecture is the most widely used architecture on computers in the world.

## What happen when i press power on button ❓

There are 2 important things involved in the process here, there are BIOS and Bootloader.
