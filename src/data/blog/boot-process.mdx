Welcome to the (OS Journey)[https://muhammadichsan.com/tags] series ðŸ¥³, in this series we will learn together about operating systems in depth. To understand the OS, of course, we also have to learn about computer science, because these two things are related. Before we start into main topic (OS) later we will also discuss such as CPU, Memory Management, and Kernel, of course this will be fun to learn right ðŸ˜„?
