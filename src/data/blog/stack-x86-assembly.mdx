Basic knowledge of memory is the main foundation for programmers to build a good system. For programmers with high-level languages, there are 2 memories that they must learn, that are Hard Disk and RAM. The two memories work together with the processor to run the program, when the executable file of our program is run, the OS will take all things related to the program then put it into RAM and the processor will execute the program instruction by instruction, that is how the program works in a nutshell.

In practice, memory will usually be divided into several units with different names and functions. In RAM you may find many confusing terms, such as Heap, Segment, Memory Address, Subroutine, or Stack. These terms refer to the naming of the memory section in a program that is made either logically or physically.

For the first time in this article we will discuss one of the data structures in memory that called **Stack**, so let's get into the discussion ðŸ”¥
