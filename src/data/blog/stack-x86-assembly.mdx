Basic knowledge of memory is the main foundation for programmers to build a good system. For programmers with high-level languages, there are 2 memories that they must learn, that are Hard Disk and RAM. The two memories work together with the processor to run the program, when the executable file of our program is run, the OS will take all things related to the program then put it into RAM and the processor will execute the program instruction by instruction.
