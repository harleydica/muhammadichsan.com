Inside the processor, whether it's a modern processor or an old version, they certainly have a small memory area that has the most influential role in processor performance, it's called a **Register**.

This memory only has a very small memory size (the largest currently is 8 bytes), even though it is small but registers have a very fast speed that far exceeds other memory.
