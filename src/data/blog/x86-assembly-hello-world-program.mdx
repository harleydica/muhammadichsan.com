x86 assembly is an interesting language for us to learn, considering the architecture of this language is already used by most modern computers today.

To start learning a language, we should start by creating a simple program, for example the Hello World program. In this article we will learn together to make the program and will discuss it line by line.

So let's go ðŸš€

## Looking into code ðŸ”Ž

> In this tutorial i use x86-32 bit assembly with NASM assembler and Debian distro

The code below is a hello world with x86 assembly program

```wasm
global _start

section .data
    msg: db "Hello World!", 0xa
    len: equ $-msg

section .text

_start:
    mov eax, 4
    mov ebx, 1
    mov ecx, msg
    mov edx, len
    int 0x80

    mov al,1
    mov ebx,0
    int 0x80
```

Run that code with the following command.

```bash
// tells nasm that the output file object is elf 32 bit
nasm -f elf32 -o hello-world.o hello-world.s
// link hello-world.o with other neccesary object file
ld -o hello-world hello-world.o
```

After you run the two commands then there will be an executable file, and you can execute it with `./hello-world` command.

For convert from assembly to object file i use `-f elf32` option. This option means that we ask nasm to create an object file of type elf 32, elf (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for object files used for Unix & Unix-like systems on x86 processors. Other option of -f flag you can see it through the [NASM manual](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~comp03/nasm/nasmdoc6.html).
