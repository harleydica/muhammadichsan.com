x86 assembly is an interesting language for us to learn, considering the architecture of this language is already used by most modern computers today.

To start learning a language, we should start by creating a simple program, for example the Hello World program. In this article we will learn together to make that program with x86 assembly and we will discuss the program line by line.

So let's go 🚀

## Looking into code 👁️

> In this tutorial i use x86-32 bit assembly with NASM assembler and Debian distro

The code below is a hello world program with x86 assembly languange.

```wasm
global _start

section .data
    msg: db "Hello World!", 0xa
    len: equ $-msg

section .text

_start:
    mov eax, 4
    mov ebx, 1
    mov ecx, msg
    mov edx, len
    int 0x80

    mov al,1
    mov ebx,0
    int 0x80
```

Run that code with the following command.

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o hello-world.o hello-world.s
ld -o hello-world hello-world.o
```

After you run the two commands then there will be an executable file, and you can execute it with `./hello-world` command.

For convert from assembly to object file i use `-f elf32` option. This option means that we ask nasm to create an object file of type elf 32, elf (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for object files used for Unix & Unix-like systems on x86 processors. Other option of -f flag you can see it through the [NASM manual](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~comp03/nasm/nasmdoc6.html).

## Code explanation 🔎

In the first line we have `global _start`, what is it?

### global _start

Like EXTERN in C, the global directive in NASM functions to change a variable so that it has global access. Usually the global keyword is used in conjunction with _start, it serves to tell the program from which point it starts code execution. A pair of `global _keyword` it will be useful if in your .text section you have a label, if you don't have a label in it then you shouldn't have to declare it.

**_start** is the default label starting point created by NASM. Because it's the default, we can change it, to change it we can use the `-e` option during the linker process. For example, I want to change the starting point of the program to myStart label, then that subroutine will call the _start label, like the code below.

```wasm
...
myStart:
    mov ebx, 1
    jmp _start

_start:
    mov eax, 1
```

Now to notify NASM that the program's starting point is changed to myStart we can add the options below.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

ld -e myStart -o hello-world hello-world.o
```

When the program is run, it will work on the code in the myStart label first, until it reaches the `jmp _start` line, the _start label will be executed.
