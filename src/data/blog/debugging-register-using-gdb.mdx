Register is a memory unit that has a very small capacity, has the fastest speed, and is located very close to the processing unit of the processor. In the x86 architecture especially IA-32 (32bit) there are about 16 registers that you can find, each register has its own function and they have a memory capacity of 32bit.

To study these registers, we can debug the assembly code that we run. With a tool called GDB later we will be able to see the contents of the register in real time with every assembly instruction that we give.

Okay no need to take too long, let's do that now 🏎️
